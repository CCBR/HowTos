The unique_feature_name will be created from the develop branch.\nCode normally, make frequent commits, push frequently to remote. These commits are added to the unique_feature_name branch.\nWhen you are ready to add your feature enhancements back to the develop branch, you may have to make sure that the develop branch has not marched forward while you were working on the unique_feature_name feature (This is possible as other may have added their PRs in the interim). If it has, then you may have to pull in changes made to develop branch into your unique_feature_name feature branch. This can be achieved using the GitHub web interface… merge develop &lt;– unique_feature_name. Resolve conflicts if any.\nRetest your unique_feature_name branch.\nNow send in a pull request using the GitHub web interface to pull your unique_feature_name into develop branch.\nOccasionally, we may create a new release branch from the develop branch and perform thorough E2E testing with fixes.

The unique_feature_name will be created from the develop branch.\nCode normally, make frequent commits, push frequently to remote. These commits are added to the unique_feature_name branch.\nWhen you are ready to add your feature enhancements back to the develop branch, you may have to make sure that the develop branch has not marched forward while you were working on the unique_feature_name feature (This is possible as other may have added their PRs in the interim). If it has, then you may have to pull in changes made to develop branch into your unique_feature_name feature branch. This can be achieved using the GitHub web interface… merge develop &lt;– unique_feature_name. Resolve conflicts if any.\nRetest your unique_feature_name branch.\nNow send in a pull request using the GitHub web interface to pull your unique_feature_name into develop branch.\nOccasionally, we may create a new release branch from the develop branch and perform thorough E2E testing with fixes.

You will need to edit this file to include the channels and edit any information on the the package version number or dependency version numbers.\nHere is an example of the top of the meta.yaml file with the channels section added:\n{% set version = '0.9.5.2' %}\n\n{% set posix = 'm2-' if win else '' %}\n{% set native = 'm2w64-' if win else '' %}\n\npackage:\n  name: r-dspworkflow\n  version: {{ version|replace(\"-\", \"_\") }}\n\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - bioconda\n  - default\n  - file://rstudio-files/RH/ccbr-projects/Conda_package_tutorial/local_channel/channel\n\nsource:\n\n  git_url: https://github.com/NIDAP-Community/DSPWorkflow\n  git_tag: 0.9.5\n\nbuild:\n  merge_build_host: True  # [win]\n  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build number.\n  number: 0\n  # no skip\n\n  # This is required to make R link correctly on Linux.\n  rpaths:\n    - lib/R/lib/\n    - lib/\n\n    # Suggests: testthat (== 3.1.4)\nrequirements:\n  build:\n    - {{ posix }}filesystem        # [win]\n    - {{ posix }}git\n    - {{ posix }}zip               # [win]\nHere is an example of the sections for specifying dependency versions from the meta.yaml file:\n  host:\n    - r-base =4.1.3=h2f963a2_5\n    - bioconductor-biobase =2.54.0=r41hc0cfd56_2\n    - bioconductor-biocgenerics =0.40.0=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - bioconductor-geomxtools =3.1.1=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - bioconductor-nanostringnctools =1.2.0\n    - bioconductor-spatialdecon =1.4.3\n    - bioconductor-complexheatmap =2.10.0=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - r-cowplot =1.1.1=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-dplyr =1.0.9=r41h7525677_0\n    - r-ggforce =0.3.4=r41h7525677_0\n    - r-ggplot2 =3.3.6=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-gridextra =2.3=r41hc72bb7e_1004\n    - r-gtable =0.3.0=r41hc72bb7e_3\n    - r-knitr =1.40=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-patchwork =1.1.2=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-reshape2 =1.4.4=r41h7525677_2\n    - r-scales =1.2.1=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-tibble =3.1.8=r41h06615bd_1\n    - r-tidyr =1.2.1=r41h7525677_1\n    - r-umap =0.2.9.0=r41h7525677_1\n    - r-rtsne =0.16=r41h37cf8d7_1\n    - r-magrittr =2.0.3=r41h06615bd_1\n    - r-rlang =1.1.0=r41h38f115c_0\n\n  run:\n    - r-base =4.1.3=h2f963a2_5\n    - bioconductor-biobase =2.54.0=r41hc0cfd56_2\n    - bioconductor-biocgenerics =0.40.0=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - bioconductor-geomxtools =3.1.1=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - bioconductor-nanostringnctools =1.2.0\n    - bioconductor-spatialdecon =1.4.3\n    - bioconductor-complexheatmap =2.10.0=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - r-cowplot =1.1.1=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-dplyr =1.0.9=r41h7525677_0\n    - r-ggforce =0.3.4=r41h7525677_0\n    - r-ggplot2 =3.3.6=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-gridextra =2.3=r41hc72bb7e_1004\n    - r-gtable =0.3.0=r41hc72bb7e_3\n    - r-knitr =1.40=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-patchwork =1.1.2=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-reshape2 =1.4.4=r41h7525677_2\n    - r-scales =1.2.1=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-tibble =3.1.8=r41h06615bd_1\n    - r-tidyr =1.2.1=r41h7525677_1\n    - r-umap =0.2.9.0=r41h7525677_1\n    - r-rtsne =0.16=r41h37cf8d7_1\n    - r-magrittr =2.0.3=r41h06615bd_1\n    - r-rlang =1.1.0=r41h38f115c_0\nIn the above example, each of the dependencies has been assigned a conda build string, so that when conda builds a conda package, it will only use that specific build of the dependency from the listed conda channels. The above example is very restrictive, the dependencies can also be listed in the “meta.yaml” file to be more open–it will choose a conda build string that fits in with the other resolved dependency build strings based on what is available in the channels.\nAlso note that the “host” section matches the “run” section.\nHere is some examples of a more open setup for these dependencies:\n  host:\n    - r-base &gt;=4.1.3\n    - bioconductor-biobase &gt;=2.54.0\n    - bioconductor-biocgenerics &gt;=0.40.0\n    - bioconductor-geomxtools &gt;=3.1.1\n    - bioconductor-nanostringnctools &gt;=1.2.0\n    - bioconductor-spatialdecon =1.4.3\n    - bioconductor-complexheatmap &gt;=2.10.0\n    - r-cowplot &gt;=1.1.1\n    - r-dplyr &gt;=1.0.9\n    - r-ggforce &gt;=0.3.4\n    - r-ggplot2 &gt;=3.3.6\n    - r-gridextra &gt;=2.3\n    - r-gtable &gt;=0.3.0\n    - r-knitr &gt;=1.40\n    - r-patchwork &gt;=1.1.2\n    - r-reshape2 &gt;=1.4.4\n    - r-scales &gt;=1.2.1\n    - r-tibble &gt;=3.1.8\n    - r-tidyr &gt;=1.2.1\n    - r-umap &gt;=0.2.9.0\n    - r-rtsne &gt;=0.16\n    - r-magrittr &gt;=2.0.3\n    - r-rlang &gt;=1.1.0",

    "text": "parkit\nparkit is designed to assist analysts in archiving project data from the NIH’s Helix/Helix systems to the HPC-DME storage platform. It provides functionalities to package and store data such as raw FastQ files or processed data from bioinformatics pipelines. Users can automatically: - create tarballs of their data (including .filelist and .md5sum files), - generate metadata, - create collections on HPC-DME, and - deposit tar files into the system for long-term storage. parkit also features comprehensive workflows that support both folder-based and tarball-based archiving. This integration ensures that bioinformatics project data is securely archived and well-organized, allowing for seamless long-term storage.\n\n❗ NOTE: HPC DME API CLUs should already be setup as per these instructions in order to use parkit\n\n\n❗ NOTE: HPC_DM_UTILS environment variable should be set to point to the utils folder under the HPC_DME_APIs repo setup. Please see these instructions.\n\n\n❗ NOTE: If it has been a few months since you last used HPC_DME_APIs or parkit or projark, then please run the following commands before you start using parkit or projark:\ncd $HPC_DM_UTILS\ngit pull\nsource $HPC_DM_UTILS/functions\ndm_generate_token\n\nprojark is the preferred parkit command to completely archive an entire folder as a tarball on HPCDME.

    "text": "Why GitHub Copilot?\nGitHub Copilot is built to work seamlessly in your IDE. It acts a bridge between you, your codebase, and LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, etc. Copilot makes suggestions based on the context of your entire project, rather than only a single prompt.\nWith the web interfaces for ChatGPT, Claude, etc, you would have to upload your code in order for it to have access to the context of your project. Further, you would have to copy & paste suggestions from the browser into your IDE. If you frequently switch between working on multiple projects, or have large projects with hundreds or thousands of lines of code, this can quickly become cumbersome.\nGitHub Copilot in your IDE removes friction and makes using LLMs for development tasks a breeze!",

If needed, start typing \"\"\" and see if that triggers Copilot to suggest a docstring.\n{fig-alt=VS Code editor window showing GitHub Copilot automatically suggesting code as light gray text inline with the user’s typing.}\nYou can press TabTab to accept the suggestion, or EscEsc to reject it.\n\n\n\nInline chat\nPress Cmd-ICmd-I to open the inline chat and ask for modifications right where your cursor is.\n\n\nYou can click the checkmark to accept the suggested edit if it meets your expectations. You can always modify it after accepting it if there are minor corrections to make.\n\n\nChat in the sidebar\nSometimes you may have more long-form questions, or perhaps you’d like to have a record of the prompts you’ve given to Copilot. The sidebar Chat is great for this!\nYou can toggle the sidebar on and off with the sidebar button in the upper right corner of the VS Code window:\n\n\n\nOpen the sidebar\n\n\nYou can select which Large Language Model to use for your prompts:\n\n\n\nModel selection\n\n\n\nExample: ask Copilot to explain how a line of code works.\nHighlight a complicated line of code and ask Copilot to explain how it works.\n\n\n\nExample: ask Copilot to break out a complicated line of code into a separate function.\n\n\nIf you are not in Agent mode, you will need to make the modifications yourself. But Copilot’s instructions make it very clear how to do so!\n\n\nExample: ask Copilot to explain the benefits of yield vs return in Python functions\n\n\n\n\nExample: Writing unit tests\nAsk Copilot to suggest unit tests for the Python script.\n\nCopilot suggested a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the script.\n\nIf you’re not sure where to place the tests, Copilot has a detailed suggestion:\n \nBe sure to read through the unit tests, understand what they’re testing and why, and consider if there are any gaps in test coverage that you will need to correct.\n\n\n\nSource Control: git GUI in VS Code\nCopilot can even suggest commit messages for you! Using the Source Control extension, add your script to the git staging area and ask Copilot to suggest a commit message.\n\nClick the sparkles ✨ icon on the right side of the commit message box to generate a commit message using Copilot.\n\nRead the commit message and make sure it accurately describes the changes you’ve made before you accept it.",

It provides functionalities to package and store data such as raw FastQ files or processed data from bioinformatics pipelines. Users can automatically:\n\ncreate tarballs of their data (including .filelist and .md5sum files),\ngenerate metadata,\ncreate collections on HPC-DME, and\ndeposit tar files into the system for long-term storage.\n\nparkit also features comprehensive workflows that support both folder-based and tarball-based archiving. These workflows are integrated with the SLURM job scheduler, enabling efficient execution of archival tasks on the Biowulf HPC cluster. This integration ensures that bioinformatics project data is securely archived and well-organized, allowing for seamless long-term storage.\n\n❗ NOTE: HPC DME API CLUs should already be setup as per these instructions in order to use parkit\n\n\n❗ NOTE: HPC_DM_UTILS environment variable should be set to point to the utils folder under the HPC_DME_APIs repo setup.

To edit how your cache is saved perform the following steps:\n\nCreate a new directory where you would like to store the conda cache called ‘conda-cache’\n\nmkdir conda/conda-cache\n\nIn your home directory, create the file .condarc\n\ntouch ~/.condarc\n\nOpen the new file .condarc and add the following sections:\n\n\npkgs_dirs\nenvs_dirs\nconda-build\nchannels\n\nIn each section you will add the path to the directories you would like to use for each section.\nExample:\nkgs_dirs:\n  - /rstudio-files/ccbr-data/users/$USER/conda-cache\nenvs_dirs:\n  - /rstudio-files/ccbr-data/users/$USER/conda-envs\nconda-build:\n    root-dir: /rstudio-files/ccbr-data/users/$USER/conda-bld\n    build_folder: /rstudio-files/ccbr-data/users/$USER/conda-bld\n    conda-build\n  output_folder: /rstudio-files/ccbr-data/users/$USER/conda-bld/conda-output\nchannels:\n  - file://rstudio-files/RH/ccbr-projects/Conda_package_tutorial/local_channel/channel\n  - conda-forge\n  - bioconda\n  - defaults\n\n\n\nTo check that conda has been setup with the specified paths from .condarc start conda:\nconda activate\nThen check the conda info:\nconda info\n\n\nTo build a Conda package, ‘channels’ are needed to supply the dependencies that are specified in the DESCRIPTION and meta.yaml files (discussed below). These R packages in these channels are also Conda packages that have been previously built as a specific version of that package and given a ‘build string’, a unique indentifier for the build of that specific conda package.\nFor channels to be available to you when you build your own conda package, you first need to add them. To add a Conda channel run:\nconfig –add channels \nFor , some examples are:\n\nfile://rstudio-files/RH/ccbr-projects/Conda_package_tutorial/local_channel/channel\nconda-forge\nbioconda\ndefaults\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a package with Conda, you first need to make a new release and tag in the github repo of the R package you would like to create into a Conda Package.\nFor more information on best practices in R package creation, see:\nhttps://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\nBefore creating the release on github, please check for proper dependencies listed in the files NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION.\nThese files should have the same list of dependencies, and the version numbers for dependencies can be specified in the DESCRIPTION file. The DESCRIPTION file must be editted manually, while the NAMESPACE file should not be editted manually, but rather created automatically using the document() function.\nThe DESCRITPION file must also be correctly formatted. For more information, see:\nhttps://r-pkgs.org/description.html\n\n\nTo download the most recent release from the most recent tag on Github, activate Conda then use Conda skeleton like so:\nconda activate\n\nconda skeleton cran $githubURL\nReplace $githubURL with the URL to your R package’s github repo.\nA folder is then created for the downloaded release, for example running the following:\nconda skeleton cran https://github.com/NIDAP-Community/DSPWorkflow\ncreates the folder\nr-dspworkflow\nWithin this newly created folder is a file named “meta.yaml”. You will need to edit this file to include the channels and edit any information on the the package version number or dependency version numbers.\nHere is an example of the top of the “meta.yaml” file with the channels section added:\n{% set version = '0.9.5.2' %}\n\n{% set posix = 'm2-' if win else '' %}\n{% set native = 'm2w64-' if win else '' %}\n\npackage:\n  name: r-dspworkflow\n  version: {{ version|replace(\"-\", \"_\") }}\n\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - bioconda\n  - default\n  - file://rstudio-files/RH/ccbr-projects/Conda_package_tutorial/local_channel/channel\n\nsource:\n\n  git_url: https://github.com/NIDAP-Community/DSPWorkflow\n  git_tag: 0.9.5\n\nbuild:\n  merge_build_host: True  # [win]\n  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build number.\n  number: 0\n  # no skip\n\n  # This is required to make R link correctly on Linux.\n  rpaths:\n    - lib/R/lib/\n    - lib/\n\n    # Suggests: testthat (== 3.1.4)\nrequirements:\n  build:\n    - {{ posix }}filesystem        # [win]\n    - {{ posix }}git\n    - {{ posix }}zip               # [win]\nHere is an example of the sections for specifying dependency versions from the “meta.yaml” file:\n  host:\n    - r-base =4.1.3=h2f963a2_5\n    - bioconductor-biobase =2.54.0=r41hc0cfd56_2\n    - bioconductor-biocgenerics =0.40.0=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - bioconductor-geomxtools =3.1.1=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - bioconductor-nanostringnctools =1.2.0\n    - bioconductor-spatialdecon =1.4.3\n    - bioconductor-complexheatmap =2.10.0=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - r-cowplot =1.1.1=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-dplyr =1.0.9=r41h7525677_0\n    - r-ggforce =0.3.4=r41h7525677_0\n    - r-ggplot2 =3.3.6=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-gridextra =2.3=r41hc72bb7e_1004\n    - r-gtable =0.3.0=r41hc72bb7e_3\n    - r-knitr =1.40=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-patchwork =1.1.2=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-reshape2 =1.4.4=r41h7525677_2\n    - r-scales =1.2.1=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-tibble =3.1.8=r41h06615bd_1\n    - r-tidyr =1.2.1=r41h7525677_1\n    - r-umap =0.2.9.0=r41h7525677_1\n    - r-rtsne =0.16=r41h37cf8d7_1\n    - r-magrittr =2.0.3=r41h06615bd_1\n    - r-rlang =1.1.0=r41h38f115c_0\n\n  run:\n    - r-base =4.1.3=h2f963a2_5\n    - bioconductor-biobase =2.54.0=r41hc0cfd56_2\n    - bioconductor-biocgenerics =0.40.0=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - bioconductor-geomxtools =3.1.1=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - bioconductor-nanostringnctools =1.2.0\n    - bioconductor-spatialdecon =1.4.3\n    - bioconductor-complexheatmap =2.10.0=r41hdfd78af_0\n    - r-cowplot =1.1.1=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-dplyr =1.0.9=r41h7525677_0\n    - r-ggforce =0.3.4=r41h7525677_0\n    - r-ggplot2 =3.3.6=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-gridextra =2.3=r41hc72bb7e_1004\n    - r-gtable =0.3.0=r41hc72bb7e_3\n    - r-knitr =1.40=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-patchwork =1.1.2=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-reshape2 =1.4.4=r41h7525677_2\n    - r-scales =1.2.1=r41hc72bb7e_1\n    - r-tibble =3.1.8=r41h06615bd_1\n    - r-tidyr =1.2.1=r41h7525677_1\n    - r-umap =0.2.9.0=r41h7525677_1\n    - r-rtsne =0.16=r41h37cf8d7_1\n    - r-magrittr =2.0.3=r41h06615bd_1\n    - r-rlang =1.1.0=r41h38f115c_0\nIn the above example, each of the dependencies has been assigned a conda build string, so that when conda builds a conda package, it will only use that specific build of the dependency from the listed conda channels. The above example is very restrictive, the dependencies can also be listed in the “meta.yaml” file to be more open–it will choose a conda build string that fits in with the other resolved dependency build strings based on what is available in the channels.\nAlso note that the “host” section matches the “run” section.\nHere is some examples of a more open setup for these dependencies:\n  host:\n    - r-base &gt;=4.1.3\n    - bioconductor-biobase &gt;=2.54.0\n    - bioconductor-biocgenerics &gt;=0.40.0\n    - bioconductor-geomxtools &gt;=3.1.1\n    - bioconductor-nanostringnctools &gt;=1.2.0\n    - bioconductor-spatialdecon =1.4.3\n    - bioconductor-complexheatmap &gt;=2.10.0\n    - r-cowplot &gt;=1.1.1\n    - r-dplyr &gt;=1.0.9\n    - r-ggforce &gt;=0.3.4\n    - r-ggplot2 &gt;=3.3.6\n    - r-gridextra &gt;=2.3\n    - r-gtable &gt;=0.3.0\n    - r-knitr &gt;=1.40\n    - r-patchwork &gt;=1.1.2\n    - r-reshape2 &gt;=1.4.4\n    - r-scales &gt;=1.2.1\n    - r-tibble &gt;=3.1.8\n    - r-tidyr &gt;=1.2.1\n    - r-umap &gt;=0.2.9.0\n    - r-rtsne &gt;=0.16\n    - r-magrittr &gt;=2.0.3\n    - r-rlang &gt;=1.1.0\n\n\n\nWhen the “meta.yaml” has been prepared, you can now build the Conda package.\nTo do so, run the command:\nconda-build $r-package 2&gt;&1 | tee $build_log_name.log\nReplace $r-package with the name of the R package folder that was created after running conda skeleton (the folder where the meta.yaml is located).\nExample: r-dspworkflow\nReplace $build_log_name.log with the name for the log file, such as the date, time, and initials.\nExample: 05_12_23_330_nc.log\nThe log file will list how conda has built the package, including what dependencies version numbers and corresponding build strings were used to resolve the conda environment. These dependencies are what we specified in the “meta.yaml” file. The log file will be useful troubleshooting a failed build.\nBe aware, the build can take anywhere from several minutes to an hour to complete, depending on the size of the package and the number of dependencies.\nThe conda package will be built as a tar.bz2 file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important consideration for Conda builds is the list of dependencies, specified versions, and compatibility with each of the other dependencies.\nIf the meta.yaml and DESCRIPTION file specify specific package versions, Conda’s ability to resolve the Conda environment also becomes more limited.\nFor example, if the Conda package we are building has the following requirements:\nDependency A version == 1.0\nDependency B version &gt;= 2.5\nAnd the Dependencies located in our Conda channel have the following dependencies:\nDependency A version 1.0\n  - Dependency C version == 0.5\n\nDependency A version 1.2\n- Dependency C version &gt;= 0.7\n\nDependency B version 2.7\n  - Dependency C version &gt;= 0.7\nAs you can see, the Conda build will not be able to resolve the environment because Dependency A verion 1.0 needs an old version of Dependency C, while Dependency B version 2.7 needs a newer version.\nIn this case, if we changed our package’s DESCRIPTION and meta.yaml file to be:\nDependency A version &gt;= 1.0\nDependency B version &gt;= 2.5\nThe conda build will be able to resolve. This is a simplied version of a what are more often complex dependency structures, but it is an important concept in conda package building that will inevitably arise as a package’s dependencies become more specific.\nTo check on the versions of packages that are available in a Conda channel, use the command:\nconda search $dependency\nReplace $dependency with the name of package you would like to investigate. There are more optional commands for this function which can be found here:\nhttps://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/search.html\nTo check the dependencies of packages that exist in your Conda cache, go to the folder specified for your conda cache (that we specified earlier). In case you need to find that path you can use:\nconda info\nHere there will be a folder for each of the packages that has been used in a conda build (including the dependencies). In each folder is another folder called “info” and a file called “index.json” that lists information, such as depends for the package.\nHere is an example:\ncat /rstudio-files/ccbr-data/users/$USER/conda-cache/r-ggplot2-3.3.6-r41hc72bb7e_1/info/index.json\n\n{\n \"arch\": null,\n \"build\": \"r41hc72bb7e_1\",\n \"build_number\": 1,\n \"depends\": [\n   \"r-base &gt;=4.1,&lt;4.2.0a0\",\n   \"r-digest\",\n   \"r-glue\",\n   \"r-gtable &gt;=0.1.1\",\n   \"r-isoband\",\n   \"r-mass\",\n   \"r-mgcv\",\n   \"r-rlang &gt;=0.3.0\",\n   \"r-scales &gt;=0.5.0\",\n   \"r-tibble\",\n   \"r-withr &gt;=2.0.0\"\n ],\n \"license\": \"GPL-2.0-only\",\n \"license_family\": \"GPL2\",\n \"name\": \"r-ggplot2\",\n \"noarch\": \"generic\",\n \"platform\": null,\n \"subdir\": \"noarch\",\n \"timestamp\": 1665515494942,\n \"version\": \"3.3.6\"\n}\nIf you would like to specify an exact package to use in a conda channel for your conda build, specify the build string in your “meta.yaml” file. In the above example for ggplot version 3.3.6, the build string is listed in the folder name for package as well as in the index.json file for “build:”r41hc72bb7e_1”.",

Set up an interactive session, and follow the steps below. A pre-commit configuration file is needed, and can be copied from the CCBR template repo.\n# load module on biowulf\nmodule load precommit\n\n# CD into the GitHub repo\ncd &lt;repo_name&gt;\n\n# install precommit in the repo - this is the only time you need to do this, per local repo location\npre-commit install\n\n# copy and update the precommit config\ntouch .pre-commit.config\n\n\n\nCommits must follow the format listed below, as designated by Angular:\n&lt;type&gt;(&lt;scope&gt;): &lt;subject&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\n\nThe type must be one of the following options:\n\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nperf: A code change that improves performance\nstyle: Style changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)\ntest: Adding tests or correcting existing tests\nci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature, such as to improve code understandability\nchore: Maintenance tasks that don’t affect production code behavior (e.g. configuration files)\n\nfeat, fix, docs, and perf changes are user-facing changes because they affect users of the code, and should be included in the changelog. All other types are non user-facing changes and typically do not need to be included in the changelog.\n\n\n\nThe scope must be one of the following options:\n\nanimations\ncommon\ncompiler\ncompiler-cli\ncore\nelements\nforms\nhttp\nlanguage-service\nplatform-browser\nplatform-browser-dynamic\nplatform-server\nplatform-webworker\nplatform-webworker-dynamic\nrouter\nservice-worker\nupgrade\n\n\n\n\nThe subject must be a succinct description of the change. It should follow the following rules:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”\ndon’t capitalize the first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\n\n\n\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior. It should follow the following rule:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”\n\n\n\n\nThe footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.\n\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nClosed bugs should be listed on a separate line in the footer from Breaking Changes, prefixed with “Closes” keyword (Closes #234 or Closes #123, #245, #992).\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some examples of properly formatted commit messages\n# example\ndocs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5\n\n# example\nfix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js\n\n# example\nfeat($browser): onUrlChange event (popstate/hashchange/polling)\nAdded new event to $browser:\n- forward popstate event if available\n- forward hashchange event if popstate not available\n- do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available\n\nBreaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)\n\n# example\nfix($compile): couple of unit tests for IE9\nOlder IEs serialize html uppercased, but IE9 does not...\nWould be better to expect case insensitive, unfortunately jasmine does\nnot allow to user regexps for throw expectations.\n\nCloses #392\nBreaks foo.bar api, foo.baz should be used instead",

All other types are non user-facing changes and typically do not need to be included in the changelog.\n\n\n\nThe scope must be one of the following options:\n\nanimations\ncommon\ncompiler\ncompiler-cli\ncore\nelements\nforms\nhttp\nlanguage-service\nplatform-browser\nplatform-browser-dynamic\nplatform-server\nplatform-webworker\nplatform-webworker-dynamic\nrouter\nservice-worker\nupgrade\n\n\n\n\nThe subject must be a succinct description of the change. It should follow the following rules:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”\ndon’t capitalize the first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\n\n\n\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior. It should follow the following rule:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”\n\n\n\n\nThe footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.\n\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nClosed bugs should be listed on a separate line in the footer from Breaking Changes, prefixed with “Closes” keyword (Closes #234 or Closes #123, #245, #992).\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some examples of properly formatted commit messages\n# example\ndocs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5\n\n# example\nfix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js\n\n# example\nfeat($browser): onUrlChange event (popstate/hashchange/polling)\nAdded new event to $browser:\n- forward popstate event if available\n- forward hashchange event if popstate not available\n- do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available\n\nBreaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)\n\n# example\nfix($compile): couple of unit tests for IE9\nOlder IEs serialize html uppercased, but IE9 does not...\nWould be better to expect case insensitive, unfortunately jasmine does\nnot allow to user regexps for throw expectations.\n\nCloses #392\nBreaks foo.bar api, foo.baz should be used instead",
