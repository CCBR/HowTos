title: Build docker containers interactively with Google Cloud Shell
---

As of this writing, Docker Desktop is not approved for use on NCI laptops.
If you want to build and push docker containers using the docker CLI, 
you can use the Google Cloud Shell: <https://console.cloud.google.com/>

You can create an account with your `@nih.gov` email.
Certain aspects of Google Cloud cost money, but the free tier offers more than
enough usage for building containers with the Google Cloud Shell.

![Cloud Shell has a Terminal to run commands.](img/cloud-shell-terminal.png)

## Create a dockerfile

For this tutorial, we'll create a minimal Dockerfile with these contents:

```
FROM python:3.11

RUN mkdir -p /data2/
RUN echo 'hello world' > /data2/file.txt
```

### Upload

If you already have a Dockerfile written, you can upload it to Cloud Shell.

![In the file explorer tab, right-click and select "Upload".](img/editor-upload.png)

### Write

Create a new text file:

![Click `File` > `New Text File` and write the contents of your Dockerfile.](img/file-new.png)

Save it with the name "Dockerfile".

## Build the container

```sh
docker build -t minimal:v1 -f ./Dockerfile .
```

- `-t, --tag` - Name and optionally a tag (format: "name:tag")
- `-f, --file` - Name of the Dockerfile (default: "PATH/Dockerfile")

Run `docker build --help` for more options.

## Test the container image

Run the container interactively with the bash shell:

```sh
docker run -it minimal:v1 bash
```

Run any commands you wish inside the container to test that everything you need
was installed correctly.

```sh
cat /data2/file.txt
which python
python --version
```

![This container should have python installed and should have the "hello world" file.](img/docker-run-bash.png)

Close the container with {{{< kbd Ctrl-D >}}} or type `exit`.

If the container doesn't have the software you expected, 
something went wrong during the build process.
Try editing the Dockerfile and re-building the container.

## Push the container to dockerhub

If your container was built successfully, you can push it to a container registry
such as dockerhub so yourself and others can pull it for use on other platforms.

### Log in to dockerhub

```sh
docker login
```

![Open your web browser and type in the confirmation code. This step goes very smoothly if you're already logged in to dockerhub in your web browser.](img/docker-login.png)

If it worked, you'll see "Login Succeeded" in the Terminal.

### Tag & push the container image

Add a tag to the image with your username or the namespace on dockerhub (e.g.
`nciccbr`) that you want to push the container to.

Change `NAMESPACE` in the following command to your username or namespace.

```sh
docker image tag minimal:v1 NAMESPACE/minimal:v1
```

Push the container image to dockerhub:

```sh
docker push NAMESPACE/minimal:v1
```

![In these examples, the namespace is `kellysovacool` (my username)](img/docker-tag-push.png)

![If the push succeeded, you'll see it in your list of repositories on dockerhub](img/dockerhub-repos.png)

![On the repository page, you can see the list of tags that have been pushed and optionally add a description, category, overview, etc.](img/dockerhub-minimal.png)
