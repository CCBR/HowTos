title: How to use containers with singularity on biowulf
---

Log in to biowulf and start an [interactive session](https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/userguide.html#int).

```sh
sinteractive
```

Load the singularity module
```sh
module load singularity
```

Pull the container image from dockerhub:

```sh
singularity pull docker://kellysovacool/minimal:v2
```

Singularity will convert the docker image to a SIF file and write it in your current directory.

```sh
file minimal_v2.sif
```
> minimal_v2.sif: a /usr/bin/env run-singularity script executable (binary data)

Run the container in an interactive bash shell:
```sh
singularity shell minimal_v2.sif bash
```

Alternatively, you can pull the container and run it interactively in one command like this:

```sh
singularity shell docker://kellysovacool/minimal:v1 bash
```

Run any commands you wish to while inside the container.

You can exit the container by typing `exit` and pressing enter.

## Cache directory

Singularity caches images in a directory set by the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` environment variable.
By default, this is set to `$HOME/.singularity`. 
However, there is limited space in user's home directories.
Instead, we recommend setting it to a location with more disk space, such as
`/data/$USER/.singularity`.

You can set this custom cache directory location by pasting the following line in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/data/$USER/.singularity
```

This will take effect if you log out and log back in, or source your rc file.
You can check the cache directory variable like so:

```sh
echo $SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR
```
> /data/$USER/.singularity

(Your own username will appear instead of `$USER`.)
