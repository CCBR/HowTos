# Overview
The [UCSC Genome Browser]() allows for visualization of genomic data in an interactive and shareable format. User's must create accounts with their NIH credentials, and have to be connect to VPN in order to view and create the tracks. Once bigwig files are generated and stored in a shared data location, genomic tracks can be edited, and permanent links created, accessible for collaborators to view.
