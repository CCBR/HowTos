## Why CoPilot?

https://github.com/settings/copilot/features

CoPilot is built to work seamlessly in your IDE. It is a bridge between you, your codebase, and LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
CoPilot makes suggestions based on the context of your entire project, rather than only a single prompt.

## Setup

### Sign up for CoPilot

:::{.callout-note}
We cannot add more users to the NCI Enterprise premium CoPilot license at this time.

GitHub CoPilot also works well in Positron, an IDE created by Posit based on VS Code.

- Write tests to make sure your code works the way you think it does
- Use git and commit your changes often
- Periodically step back and reflect on what you're trying to accomplish
