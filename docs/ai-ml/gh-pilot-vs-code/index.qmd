## Why CoPilot?

CoPilot is built to work seamlessly in your IDE. 
It is a bridge between you, your codebase, and LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
Copilot makes suggestions based on the context of your entire project, rather than only a single prompt.

With the web interface for ChatGPT, Claude, etc, you would have to upload your code in order for it to have access to the context of your project. Further, you would have to copy & paste suggestions from the browser into your IDE. If you frequently switch between working on multiple projects, or have large projects with hundreds or thousands of lines of code, this can get onerous quickly.

GitHub CoPilot in your IDE removes friction and makes using LLMs for development tasks a breeze!

3. Start using Copilot in VS Code!

The [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension should now be installed.

#### VS Code settings

You can customize CoPilot settings in VS Code by going to **Settings** > **Extensions** > **GitHub Copilot** or by using the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd Cmd , >}} on Mac.

![](img/vscode-settings.png){fig-alt="VS Code settings interface showing GitHub Copilot configuration options under the Features section. Two checkboxes are visible and enabled: Auto Fix which automatically fixes diagnostics for edited files, and Current Editor Context which includes the name of the current active editor in the context for agent mode."}

:::{.callout-tip}
GitHub CoPilot also works well in Positron, an IDE created by Posit based on VS Code.

## Demo: a simple python script

Example project: given a GTF file, extract the gene transcription start sites and
create a BED file of promoter regions.

Files:

- [extract_promoters.py](./demo/extract_promoters.py) - Example Python script for demonstrating CoPilot
- [setup.sh](./demo/setup.sh) - Download data files for testing the Python script

### Open project in new window

Create a new directory for your project and open it with VS Code.

![](img/open-vs-code.png)

We recommend initializing git and making a commit with the existing code before you start using CoPilot.

```sh
pwd
# /path/to/extract-promoters/
git init
git add extract_promoters.py setup.sh
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

### Automatic inline suggestions

![How to turn automatic inline suggestions on and off](img/inline-suggest-enabled.png)
 <vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.enabled>

Example: ask Copilot to write a docstring.

### Inline chat

Example: ask Copilot to break out a complicated line of code into a separate function.

{{< kbd Cmd I >}}

### Chat in sidebar

![Open the sidebar](img/chat-sidebar.png)

![Model selection](img/model-selection)

Example: ask Copilot to explain how a function works

Example: ask Copilot to explain the benefits of `yield` vs `return` in Python functions

### Source Control: git GUI in VS Code

Suggest commit messages

### Writing unit tests

Ask Copilot to suggest unit tests

## Tips

- Always read and **understand** the AI suggestion before accepting it
- Write tests to make sure your code works the way you think it does
- Use git and commit your changes often
- Periodically step back and reflect on what you're trying to accomplish
