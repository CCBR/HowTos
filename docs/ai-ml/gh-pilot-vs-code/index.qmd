## Why CoPilot?

https://github.com/settings/copilot/features

CoPilot is built to work seamlessly in your IDE. It is a bridge between you, your codebase, and LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
CoPilot makes suggestions based on the context of your entire project, rather than only a single prompt.

## Setup

### Request CoPilot access

> request access to Copilot by going to https://github.com/settings/copilot and requesting access under "Get Copilot from an organization."
>
> - _[GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/what-is-github-copilot#getting-access-to-copilot)_

### Set up CoPilot in VS Code

[_VS Code Docs_](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/get-code-suggestions/get-ide-code-suggestions)
