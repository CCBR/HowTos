## Why CoPilot?

CoPilot is built to work seamlessly in your IDE. 
It is a bridge between you, your codebase, and LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
CoPilot makes suggestions based on the context of your entire project, rather than only a single prompt.

With the web interface for ChatGPT, Claude, etc, you would have to upload your code in order for it to have access to the context of your project. Further, you would have to copy & paste suggestions from the browser into your IDE. If you frequently switch between working on multiple projects, or have large projects with hundreds or thousands of lines of code, this can get onerous quickly.

GitHub CoPilot in your IDE removes friction and makes using LLMs for development tasks a breeze!

GitHub CoPilot also works well in Positron, an IDE created by Posit based on VS Code.

## Demo: a simple python script

### Open project in new window

Example project: given a GTF file, extract the gene transcription start sites and
create a BED file of promoter regions.

First, commit your existing code before you start using CoPilot.

### Automatic inline suggestions

### Writing unit tests

Ask Copilot to suggest unit tests

## Tips

- Always read and **understand** the AI suggestion before accepting it
- Write tests to make sure your code works the way you think it does
- Use git and commit your changes often
- Periodically step back and reflect on what you're trying to accomplish
