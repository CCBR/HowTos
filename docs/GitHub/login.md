If you are like me and hate to re-enter (username and) password everytime you push/pull to/from github (or mkdocs gh-deploy), then it is totally worthwhile to spend a couple minutes to set up SSH keys for auto-authentication. 

It does not make any sense for me to repeat these, as the instructions are already available [here](https://blog.corsego.com/aws-cloud9-github-ssh).
