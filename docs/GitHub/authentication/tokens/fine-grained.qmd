:::{.callout-tip}
If you are trying to authenticate to GitHub for syncing repos from your laptop
(i.e. `git push` / `git pull`), we recommending using SSH keys instead of
fine-grained tokens. See the [instructions for using SSH keys with
GitHub](/docs/GitHub/authentication/ssh-keys) for details.
:::

Fine-grained tokens can be used to authenticate with GitHub when using the
GitHub API or syncing repositories over HTTPS. Each token can be granted
specific, granular permissions for the types of actions they can make (e.g.
editing repo contents, triggering github actions, etc.), and they can be scoped
to work for an entire account/organization or only specific repositories within
an organization. One significant limitation is each fine-grained token can only
be granted permissions for one account or organization at a time; this is
intentional for security reasons. Additionally, NCI Enterprise requires GitHub
tokens to expire at least every 90 days, so you will need to regenerate them
regularly.

In most cases you should instead use either [SSH
keys](/docs/GitHub/authentication/ssh-keys) or [GitHub
apps](https://ccbr.github.io/actions/gh-app-auth.html), but some times you do
need to use a fine-grained token such as for [Code
Ocean](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/git-provider-integration-guide/setting-up-the-integration)

## Creating a new token

Navigate to the fine-grained tokens page on GitHub:
<https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens>

Click `Generate new token`

![](./generate.png)

Fill out the token name and description. It should be descriptive enough that
you will know why you created the token and how it is being used when you come
back to this page in three months.

Select the **Resource owner**, set the Expiration to **90 days**, and select
**All repositories** for access. The token will have access to any repository in
the resource owner (an organization or your personal account) that you have
access to.

Under **Permissions**, click `Add permissions` and add the scopes that the token
will need to access. Most likely you will need to add `Read and write` access
for `Contents`, and perhaps also `Workflows`.

Once you're ready, click `Generate token`.

Copy the token to your clipboard.

Protect the token just like you protect your passwords! Do not share it with
anyone.

### Code Ocean

If you're using this token for Code Ocean, you'll need to add it to your Code
Ocean Account. In Code Ocean, click the Account icon, go to `Credentials`, click
`Add Credentials`, and select `GitHub Credentials`.

Enter your GitHub username and paste in the **token** you just created.

Click `Add Credential`. You're ready to sync repos with GitHub in Code Ocean!
