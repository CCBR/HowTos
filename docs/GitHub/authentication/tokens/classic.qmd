Classic Personal Access Tokens (PATs) will be completely phased out by March
1st, 2026. Please switch to using [SSH
keys](/docs/GitHub/authentication/ssh-keys), [fine-grained
tokens](/docs/GitHub/authentication/tokens/fine-grained.qmd), or [github
apps](https://ccbr.github.io/actions/gh-app-auth.html) as appropriate for your
use-case.
