Submit a pipeline to Zenodo in order to create a DOI for publication.

## Reference link

Use the link for full information, summarized below: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9FGAU9S9Ow>

## Prepare GitHub Repository

The GitHub repository must be **public** and should include the following:

- README file
- Documentation pages, such as via mkdocs, quarto, or pkgdown, with usage and contact information
- A citation `CITATION.cff` file; [Example here](https://github.com/CCBR/CCBR_NextflowTemplate/blob/main/CITATION.cff)
- Tagged and versioned, stable repository

## Link GitHub account to Zenodo

1. Go to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
1. Select `username` in the top right >> `Profile`. Select `GitHub``
1. Click `Sync Now` (top right) to update repos. NOTE: You may have to refresh the page
1. Toggle the `On` button on the repo you wish to publish. This will move the pipeline to the `Enable Repositories` list.

## Prepare GitHub Repo

1. Go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and find the repository page.
1. Select `Releases` >> `Draft a new release`
1. Create a tag, following [semantic versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/).
1. Fill out the Release notes from the `CHANGELOG.md` or `NEWS.md` file.
1. Publish the release.

Zenodo will then automatically create a new record with a DOI for the release.

## Submit your Zenodo record to the CCBR community

Navigate to your repo's new record in Zenodo.
You can find your Zenodo records at <https://zenodo.org/me/uploads>.
Click on your new record and scroll down to the `Communities` section toward the bottom of the page,
click the gear icon, then click `Submit to community` and search for "CCBR".

Once your record is accepted by an admin, it will appear on the [CCBR community page](https://zenodo.org/communities/ccbr).

## Update Zenodo metadata

If you created a [`CITATION.cff`](https://github.com/CCBR/CCBR_NextflowTemplate/blob/main/CITATION.cff) file, Zenodo will use it to fill out the metadata.
Otherwise, you will need to edit the metadata in Zenodo manually.

Navigate to the record in Zenodo and click `Manage record` > `edit`.
Update any metadata information as needed such as the title, author names and ORCIDs, etc.

## Add DOI, citation to GitHub

1. Go to the record on Zenodo
1. Copy the all-versions DOI.
1. Return to the GitHub repository and edit the `README` of the GitHub repo, adding the DOI as a badge.
1. Update the `CITATION.cff` with the new DOI:

    ```
    identifiers:
      - description: "Archived snapshots of all versions"
        type: doi
        value: ALL_VERSIONS_DOI
    ```

    (replace `ALL_VERSIONS_DOI` with the actual DOI from Zenodo)
1. Add a line to your repo's changelog or news file under the development header to announce the new DOI:
    ```
    This repo is now archived in Zenodo with a DOI: ALL_VERSIONS_DOI
    ```
