Remember:

- All Lucid charts CCBR documents should be owned by `nciccbr@mail.nih.gov`
- Your lucidcharts username should be your `nih.gov` email address
- Only use your `nih.gov` email address to view or edit CCBR Lucidchart documents. Do not use personal email accounts.
- Share Lucidchart documents only with `nih.gov` email addresses, unless absolutely necessary.

## Existing document:

For all existing Lucid Charts documents, transfer ownership to `nciccbr@mail.nih.gov`. This is a 2-step process:
  
  - Share the document with edit permissions with `nciccbr@mail.nih.gov`. Reach out to [Vishal Koparde](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=vishal.koparde@nih.gov) to get the sharing invite accepted.
  - Once, `nciccbr@mail.nih.gov` has accepted the invite, transfer the ownership over to `nciccbr@mail.nih.gov`. For doing so please follow the instructions [here](https://help.lucid.co/hc/en-us/articles/360049435952-Transfer-Lucid-documents#transfer-individual-documents).

## Creating new document:

You can create new documents after logging into lucidcharts with your NIH.gov email account. Then, follow [the above](#existing-document) instructions to transfer ownership to `nciccbr@mail.nih.gov`.
