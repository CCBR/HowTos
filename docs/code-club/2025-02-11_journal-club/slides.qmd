## The problem

Bioinformatics is critical for biological research,
but bioinformatics software often does not follow good software engineering practices.

## Implications

- error-prone code can lead to invalid scientific findings
- technical debt - makes future changes more difficult

## Causes of poor software quality in bioinformatics

- many bioinformaticians lack training in software development
- academia credits individual researchers to aid their careers, which deincentivizes teams

## Writing good code is hard!

## The trap of "perfect" code

> _I find that when someone's taking time to do something right in the present, they're a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas when someone took time to do something right in the past, they're a master artisan of great foresight._

## The authors' proposed solution

Organize bioinformaticians into collaborative **teams** to facilitate:

1. software quality seminars
1. code reviews
1. resource sharing

(i.e. a learning community)

:::{.fragment}
### Goal
Persuade academic researchers to organize collaborative teams within their institutions to improve software quality
:::

## Lessons from the tech industry

- the team is a basic unit: there are no lone geniuses
- teams incentivize collective ownership
- the team context requires all members to adopt good software practices

:::{.notes}
you can't collaborate effectively without version control software.
your teammates won't want to work with hard-to-read code.

## Improving software dev as a team

a learning community with:

1. software quality seminars
2. code reviews
3. resource sharing

## 1. Software quality seminars

- presentations & demos covering new techniques, tools, methods, and theory
- topics are applicable across multiple projects
- result: members acquire new knowledge to apply to their projects, community gains a shared vocabulary to discuss their work

## 2. Code review sessions

- review a section of code line-by-line to offer feedback
- standard practice in industry, but seldom implemented in academia
- result: enforce consistent coding standards, detect bugs, positive peer pressure to write good

## 3. Resource sharing

- external open access resources + internal resources
- repositories, packages, libraries, seminar recordings
- result: encourages re-use and further enables knowledge sharing

## Outcomes

organizing academic bioinformaticians into teams:

- fosters collaboration while allowing individuals to retain personal ownership & advance their careers
- lowers the barrier to adapt new technologies and techniques
- improves software quality to enable deeper trust in the resulting scientific discoveries
- benefits large & small projects alike

## Future perspectives

#### Challenges in encouraging good software practices

- Funding agencies reward novelty; few grants fund maintenance
- Academia considers journal publications as _the_ token of success

:::{.fragment}
#### Silver linings
- Funding for critical software maintenance: Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Schmidt Futures
- Journal of Open Source Software: great venue for publishing scientific software

## Group discussion

- In what ways do the authors' ideas apply to us?
- How are we already applying some of their ideas?
- Are there ways we could improve our teamwork?

:::{.notes}
- Academia vs Core resource
- Reusable software vs One-time-use analysis code
