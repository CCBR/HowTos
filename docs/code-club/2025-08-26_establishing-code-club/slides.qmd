## Journal club for code

Just like a regular **journal club** seminar helps scientists keep up with the
literature in their field, **code club** helps computational scientists keep up
with best practices in software development.

## Code Club as a community of practice

> Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion
> for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.
